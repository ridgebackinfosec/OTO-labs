# Welcome to Offensive Tooling for Operators

I hope y'all are as excited for class as I am.

## Download the VMs

Before class starts, please please please download the virtual machines. The VMs are very large (~27GB) and can take a long time to finish. So, please start downloading them now.

- If you are taking this class LIVE, then use:
[https://oto.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/live/vms.zip](https://oto.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/live/vms.zip).

- If you are taking this class ON-DEMAND, then use:
[https://oto.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/on-demand/vms.zip](https://oto.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/on-demand/vms.zip).

I will go over the VM setup steps during class.

## Waiting is hard

If you're looking for something to fill the time before class, here are some webcasts I've done on the BHIS YouTube channel.
