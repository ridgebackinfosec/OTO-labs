???- warning "Active Development Warning"
    WiFi-Forge is under **active development** (AKA - this Lab may have issues) by the good folks at Black Hills Information Security. They are seeking feedback on the tool and welcome the submission of any issues on the [main GitHub page](https://github.com/blackhillsinfosec/Wifi-Forge/issues).

    A forked version can be found at [https://github.com/ridgebackinfosec/Wifi-Forge](https://github.com/ridgebackinfosec/Wifi-Forge) which should work with this Lab.

???- warning "Disk Space Requirements"
    Wifi-Forge can take up a lot of space on a VM and can create unpredicatable consequences between dependencies. It is recommended that you either create a new VM from The Forge base image or snapshot your class VM ***before*** installing Wifi-Forge.
