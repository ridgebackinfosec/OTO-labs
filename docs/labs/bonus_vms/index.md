# Bonus Target VMs
!!! warning "THIS PART IS OPTIONAL"

There are 3 additional “bonus” VMs (2 Domain Controllers and 1 Server) available for you to download at the below URL. These target VMs (coupled with your class VMs) will complete the GOAD environment should you want a larger target practice range.

There are no specific class Labs for these extra VMs and they are only meant for you to explore/attack on your own if you wish.
