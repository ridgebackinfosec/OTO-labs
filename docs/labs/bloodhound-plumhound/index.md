# Lab - BloodHound & PlumHound

???+ warning "Setup" 
    You will need at least the `GOAD-DC02` (`192.168.56.11`) target VM and The Forge VM up and running for this Lab. If you can have **both** GOAD VMs on, that would yeild even better results since we are trying to map out a whole Domain.

## Intro

Active Directory (AD) remains a prime target for attackers due to its complexity and inherent misconfigurations. In this lab, we‚Äôll use BloodHound to map relationships within AD and identify potential attack paths. We'll then integrate PlumHound to assess risk proactively, prioritizing misconfigurations before exploitation.

By the end of this exercise, you‚Äôll understand how adversaries leverage BloodHound for planning lateral movement and privilege escalation. Let‚Äôs dive in.

## Walkthrough
*Uncovering Active Directory Attack Paths Like a Pro*  

Alright, let‚Äôs walk through setting up BloodHound and PlumHound for Active Directory (AD) analysis. Think of this as a hacker‚Äôs reconnaissance mission‚Äîyou‚Äôre gathering intelligence, analyzing attack paths, and identifying weak spots in an AD environment.  

### Step 1: Kickstarting Neo4j
First things first, BloodHound needs a backend database, and that‚Äôs where Neo4j comes in. Fire up a terminal and run:  

```bash
sudo neo4j console
```

Neo4j is like BloodHound‚Äôs brain‚Äîit stores all the juicy AD relationships we‚Äôre about to collect. The `console` flag keeps it running in the foreground, so we can monitor logs and catch any errors right away. Without this, BloodHound has nowhere to dump the data, so this step is non-negotiable.

### Step 2: Launching BloodHound 
Next, we need the interface that‚Äôll let us visualize everything. Open another terminal and navigate to your BloodHound directory:  

```bash
cd BloodHound-linux-x64
./BloodHound --no-sandbox
```

![alt text](img/start-bloodhound.png)
///caption

///
  
The `--no-sandbox` flag helps avoid permission issues when running the Electron-based app. Once it launches, BloodHound will be waiting for data‚Äîso let‚Äôs give it something to work with.

### Step 3: Collecting AD Data 
Now comes the fun part: data collection. This is where we act like an attacker or pentester mapping out an AD environment. `bloodhound-python` is a tool used to collect Active Directory (AD) data for analysis in BloodHound, aiding in security assessments. In a new terminal, run:  

```bash
bloodhound-python --zip -c all -d north.sevenkingdoms.local -u brandon.stark -p iseedeadpeople -dc winterfell.north.sevenkingdoms.local -ns 127.0.0.1 --dns-timeout 60 --dns-tcp
```  

![alt text](img/data-collection.png){ width="70%" }
///caption
Data Collection
///

Breaking it down:  
- `-c all` ‚Üí Grabs everything: users, groups, ACLs, sessions‚Äîyou name it.  
- `-d north.sevenkingdoms.local` ‚Üí That‚Äôs our target AD domain.  
- `-u brandon.stark -p iseedeadpeople` ‚Üí Our credentials (hopefully, Bran has domain admin access üòâ).  
- `-dc winterfell.north.sevenkingdoms.local` ‚Üí The specific domain controller we‚Äôre hitting.  
- `-ns 127.0.0.1` ‚Üí Using our local machine for DNS resolution.  
- `--dns-timeout 60 --dns-tcp` ‚Üí Tweaks DNS settings for better reliability.  

???+ note
    By default, `bloodhound-python` uses Python‚Äôs `dns.resolver`, which may bypass `/etc/hosts`. If the DC hostname is manually mapped in `/etc/hosts`, `bloodhound-python` might fail to resolve it properly. Specifying `-ns 127.0.0.1` ensures that the system's built-in resolver is used, allowing the tool to recognize the correct IP mappings.

After running this, you‚Äôll get a ZIP file full of BloodHound-compatible JSON data. This is the blueprint of AD relationships, which we‚Äôre about to analyze.  

### Step 4: Uploading Data Into Neo4j

### Step 6: Running PlumHound for Automated Analysis  
BloodHound is great, but manually sifting through data can be a pain. That‚Äôs where PlumHound comes in‚Äîit automates the analysis for us. PlumHound is an offensive security tool that processes BloodHound JSON data to identify security risks, privilege escalation paths, and lateral movement opportunities in Active Directory environments. This guide explains how to extract, analyze, and interpret BloodHound data using PlumHound.

Open a new terminal and run these commands.

First, navigate to the PlumHound directory and activate the virtual environment:

```sh
cd ~/git-tools/PlumHound/
source venv/bin/activate
```

Breakdown:  
- `cd ~/git-tools/PlumHound/` ‚Üí Moves into the PlumHound directory.  
- `source venv/bin/activate` ‚Üí Activates the Python virtual environment, ensuring we use the correct dependencies. 

Now we can execute the PlumHound commands below.

```bash
python PlumHound.py -p ridgeback --easy
```

This first command (`--easy`) does a quick, out-of-the-box analysis.

///

```bash
python PlumHound.py -p ridgeback -x tasks/default.tasks
```
  
![alt text](img/default-tasks.png){ width="70%" }
///caption
Default Tasks
///

- The second command (`-x tasks/default.tasks`) runs a more detailed assessment based on predefined task rules.  

This step essentially translates raw BloodHound data into meaningful findings‚Äîhelping us spot privilege escalation paths and misconfigurations without manually clicking around.   

### Step 7: Reviewing the Report 
Now let‚Äôs check out what PlumHound found. Navigate to the reports folder and open the HTML report:  

```bash
cd reports/
ll
```

![alt text](img/report-list.png){ width="70%" }
///caption
Report List
///

```bash
firefox ~/git-tools/PlumHound/reports/index.html
```

![alt text](img/report.png){ width="70%" }
///caption
Report
///

This is where all our work pays off. The report will highlight attack paths, misconfigured permissions, and other AD weaknesses‚Äîlike spotting an overprivileged account that could lead to domain dominance.  

## The Big Picture 
By the time you finish this process, you‚Äôll have a **full map of Active Directory attack paths**, showing how an adversary could pivot and escalate privileges. The workflow flows like this:  

1. **Start Neo4j** ‚Üí Gives BloodHound a database.  
2. **Run BloodHound** ‚Üí Opens the GUI.  
3. **Use bloodhound-python** ‚Üí Collects real-world AD data.  
4. **Run PlumHound** ‚Üí Automates the analysis.  
5. **View the Report** ‚Üí See the results in a clear, actionable format.  

With this setup, you‚Äôre well on your way to mastering AD security‚Äîwhether you‚Äôre defending an environment or finding attack paths before the bad guys do.
